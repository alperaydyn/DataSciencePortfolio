## Business Objectives / Problem Statement
This project targets predicting late payments or dead loan. Predicting the amount of collection of the late loan payments is a performance and profitability problem for banks. The ratio of default credits changes from 2 to 10 according to the customer segment. And some customers have problem in paying their credit to more then one bank. 
So there are two aspects for this problem;
* Predicting the probability of default for each customer according to their recent activities
* Predicting the probability of payment of the late paying customer.

Preparing a model that will answer the above problems will allow the bank to collect the late payments earlier and avoid losing profit and save valuable time before the customer is set as default by other financial institutes before us.
